# Lab 14: Logging and Redirecting Output

## Objectives
- Understand how to log and redirect output in a Linux-based system.
- Learn to use the tee command for directing output to both console and a file.
- Practice writing a simple script to print multiline text and manage its output.

## Tasks
1. Write a script that prints multiline output.
2. Use `tee` to redirect output to both the console and a file simultaneously.
3. Verify results by viewing both the console output and the saved log file.

## Conclusion
In this lab, we created a script to demonstrate output redirection and logging using the `tee` command.
This technique is useful for monitoring while also persisting logs for debugging or auditing.
