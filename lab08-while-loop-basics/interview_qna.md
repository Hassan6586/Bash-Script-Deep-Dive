# Interview Q&A â€“ While Loops

**Q1.** What is a while loop in Python?  
**A1.** A control flow statement that executes as long as a condition is True.

**Q2.** How is a while loop different from a for loop?  
**A2.** `while` depends on a condition, `for` iterates over a sequence.

**Q3.** What prevents an infinite while loop?  
**A3.** A terminating condition and proper updates (like counter increments).

**Q4.** What happens if the condition is false at the start?  
**A4.** The loop body never executes.

**Q5.** How do you exit a while loop early?  
**A5.** Using the `break` statement.

**Q6.** How do you skip to the next iteration?  
**A6.** Using the `continue` statement.

**Q7.** Can while loops be nested?  
**A7.** Yes, you can place a while loop inside another.

**Q8.** How do you implement a loop with an unknown number of iterations?  
**A8.** Use a `while` loop that checks a condition until met (e.g., user input).

**Q9.** What is a counter variable?  
**A9.** A variable used to track iterations in the loop.

**Q10.** Give an example of a while loop in real-world automation.  
**A10.** Checking if a server is online every 10 seconds until it responds.
