# Lab 19 â€“ Parsing Command Output with cut, grep, awk

## Objectives
- Understand and utilize basic command-line tools like cut, grep, and awk.
- Learn how to filter and manipulate text output from commands.
- Gain hands-on experience in extracting specific data from command outputs.

## Tasks
1. Use `ps aux` to list all running processes.
2. Use `grep` to filter processes by keyword (e.g., bash, python).
3. Use `awk` to extract specific columns (PID, COMMAND, CPU%, MEM%).
4. Explore `cut` to slice text by delimiter.

## Case Study
Imagine managing a server where you must regularly check processes. Using ps aux with grep and awk, you can quickly find and analyze suspect processes without manually sifting through all output.

## Conclusion
- Mastering ps aux, grep, awk, and cut enables fast process inspection and log analysis.
- These tools are foundational for Linux system administration and automation.
